# Terrastore Web Console #



## Overview ##

Terrastore provides a pure javascript web console to easily perform the most important operations.

## Installation ##

Installing the Terrastore web console is as simple as [downloading](http://code.google.com/p/terrastore/downloads/list) the latest Terrastore web console and unpacking the distribution archive: being a pure JavaScript application, you can run it from your local filesystem or install it into your favorite web server.

In case you manually disabled [CORS](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) support, you'll also need to enable it on every Terrastore server node you want to access, as described [here](http://code.google.com/p/terrastore/wiki/Server_Guide#Setup_Cross_Origin_Resource_Sharing_support).

Terrastore web console has been tested with FireFox 3.5+, Safari 5+ and Chrome.

## Usage ##

Point your web browser to the web console _index.html_ page, configure on the right sidebar the address of the Terrastore server you want to access ... and enjoy!
